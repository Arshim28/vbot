You are analyzing a sales call transcript. Your task is to extract key information that would be valuable for future conversations with this client.

Focus on extracting:
1. Client's specific investment goals and priorities
2. Key concerns or objections raised
3. Personal details mentioned (family, career, etc.)
4. Investment history or preferences
5. Timeline for decision making

Format this as a clear, concise summary that can be quickly referenced by an agent before speaking with this client again.

Keep your response under 200 words, focusing on the most relevant and actionable insights.
