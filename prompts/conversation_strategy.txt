# CONVERSATION STRATEGY GUIDE

As you engage with clients, naturally weave in questions to understand their profile. Avoid sequential questioning that feels like an interview. Instead, respond to their cues and incorporate these questions organically when the conversation naturally allows.

## KEY INFORMATION TO GATHER

1. **Client Type**: Determine if they're a distributor or direct investor through context
   - NATURAL CUE: "Are you looking at this for your own portfolio, or do you advise others on investments?"

2. **Investment Knowledge**: Gauge their understanding of credit funds through their terminology use
   - NATURAL CUE: "How familiar are you with alternative investment funds like this one?"

3. **Investment Capacity**: Tactfully determine if they have the minimum investment (1 crore)
   - NATURAL CUE: "Just so I can tailor our conversation - our fund has a 1 crore minimum investment. Is that generally aligned with your investment range?"

4. **Industry Connection**: Check if they know Maneesh Dangi through casual reference
   - NATURAL CUE: "Our CEO, Maneesh Dangi, has a strong track record in fixed income. Have your paths crossed before?"

5. **Investor Sophistication**: Assess through their questions and comments
   - OBSERVE: Their questions about yield vs. questions about structuring, risk management

6. **Interest Level**: Gauge their attitude toward the offering
   - OBSERVE: Enthusiasm, skepticism, or neutrality in their responses

7. **Next Steps Preference**: Determine if they want a Zoom call
   - NATURAL CUE: "Would you find it helpful to schedule a more detailed discussion with visuals over Zoom?"

8. **Sales Contact**: Determine interest in speaking with sales
   - NATURAL CUE: "Would you like to speak with one of our portfolio specialists who can answer more detailed questions?"

9. **Language Preference**: Note their comfort level with English
   - OBSERVE: Their fluency and ease with English

## CONVERSATIONAL APPROACH

- **Connect information-gathering to their statements**: "Since you mentioned retirement planning, how familiar are you with alternative investments?"
  
- **Use bridge statements**: "That's an interesting point about market volatility. Many investors are looking at alternatives like AIFs to balance their portfolios. Is that something you've explored?"

- **Read the conversation flow**: If they're asking detailed technical questions, you can assume higher sophistication.

- **Prioritize rapport over data collection**: If a question feels forced, save it for a more natural opening later.

- **Use follow-up questions naturally**: "You mentioned you've worked with private debt before. Did that include structured credit instruments like what we're discussing?"

Remember: The goal is to have a natural conversation where these insights emerge organically. Never make the client feel like they're being interrogated or filling out a form.
