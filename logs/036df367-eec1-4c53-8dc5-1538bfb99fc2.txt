[2025-04-29T14:33:40.332+00:00] assistant: Steady returns are definitely a common goal. To clarify, what would you consider a comfortable level of risk to achieve those returns?
[2025-04-29T14:33:51.348+00:00] user: I don't understand this.
[2025-04-29T14:33:52.609+00:00] user: Be a bit more specific?
[2025-04-29T14:33:55.412+00:00] assistant: Okay. How do you typically approach investment risk - are you generally cautious, moderate, or aggressive in your investment choices?

[2025-04-29T14:34:54.832+00:00] assistant: Understood. Given your interest in steady returns and a moderate risk approach with 1-2 Cr, our Multi-Yield Series 1 AIF might be a fit.The expected net yield to investors, after anticipated expenses and estimated taxes, is approximately 10%.
