[2025-05-06T07:04:23.373+00:00] assistant: Hi Weird, it's Neha from Mosaic Asset Management calling you back. I hope things have been going well since we last spoke. How have you been?
[2025-05-06T07:04:33.233+00:00] user: I'm fine.
[2025-05-06T07:04:34.382+00:00] assistant: What are you generally looking for in investments right now?
[2025-05-06T07:04:40.472+00:00] user: I don't know what are your offerings.
[2025-05-06T07:04:46.802+00:00] assistant: We offer alternative investment solutions. Are you familiar with AIFs?
[2025-05-06T07:04:53.502+00:00] user: No. I'm not.
[2025-05-06T07:05:14.540+00:00] assistant: An AIF, or Alternate Investment Fund, pools money like a mutual fund but often invests in less common areas. I can brief you on our current product, Multi-Yield Series 1, if you're interested?
